                        <p>Have you ever wonderered how different types of media impact stock prices. I did and so I decided to try to correlate the change in stock prices vs the sentiment of the companies in traditinal media and on social media. I used the newsAPI for to gather data from traditinal media and 10 finance subredits to gather the sentiments of these stocks from social media.
                            Note: This project is in progress but you can see the first results here.
